# Email Normalization Fix

## Problem

The forgot password functionality was failing because of inconsistent email case handling:

```
[DEBUG] Forgot password request for email: kpinc425@gmail.com
[DEBUG] User found: False
[DEBUG] No user found for email: kpinc425@gmail.com, returning early
```

The issue was that:
1. User emails were stored in the database with mixed case (e.g., `KPInc425@gmail.com`)
2. The forgot password endpoint was normalizing input emails to lowercase
3. The database lookup was using `ilike` which should be case-insensitive, but there was inconsistency in how emails were handled throughout the application

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive email normalization system:

### 1. Added Email Normalization Function

**File: `app/models.py`**
```python
def normalize_email(email):
    """Normalize email address to lowercase and trim whitespace"""
    if email:
        return email.strip().lower()
    return email
```

### 2. Enhanced User Model

**File: `app/models.py`**
- Added `__init__` method to normalize emails during user creation
- Added `set_email()` method for normalized email updates
- Added `find_by_email()` class method for case-insensitive email lookup
- Added `find_by_email_or_username()` class method for login functionality

### 3. Updated All Email Lookups

**Files Updated:**
- `app/api.py` - Forgot password, login, registration endpoints
- `app/auth.py` - Login route
- `app/services/user_service.py` - User service methods
- `app/forms.py` - Form validation
- `admin_tools.py` - Admin user creation

### 4. Database Migration

**File: `migrate_email_normalization.py`**
- Created migration script to normalize all existing emails in the database
- Successfully migrated `KPInc425@gmail.com` → `kpinc425@gmail.com`

## Key Changes

### Before
```python
# Inconsistent email handling
email = (data.get('email') or '').strip().lower()  # Normalized input
user = User.query.filter(User.email.ilike(email)).first()  # Case-insensitive lookup
```

### After
```python
# Consistent email handling
email = (data.get('email') or '').strip()  # Keep original for display
user = User.find_by_email(email)  # Normalized lookup
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Email Handling**: All email operations now use the same normalization logic
2. **Future-Proof**: New users will have normalized emails from the start
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing users' emails are normalized without breaking functionality
4. **Improved User Experience**: Users can use any case when entering their email
5. **Security**: Prevents user enumeration through case sensitivity

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_forgot_password.py`) that verifies:
- Email normalization function works correctly
- User lookup works with different email cases
- Forgot password API accepts emails in any case

**Test Results:**
```
✅ 'KPInc425@gmail.com' -> 'kpinc425@gmail.com'
✅ Found user 'KPInc425' with email 'kpinc425@gmail.com'
✅ Found user 'KPInc425' with email 'KPInc425@gmail.com'
✅ Found user 'KPInc425' with email 'KPINC425@GMAIL.COM'
```

## Migration Status

✅ **Completed**
- Email normalization function implemented
- User model enhanced with normalized email methods
- All email lookups updated to use normalized methods
- Database migration completed successfully
- Test suite created and passing

## Files Modified

1. `app/models.py` - Added email normalization and enhanced User model
2. `app/api.py` - Updated all email-related endpoints
3. `app/auth.py` - Updated login route
4. `app/services/user_service.py` - Updated user service methods
5. `app/forms.py` - Updated form validation
6. `admin_tools.py` - Updated admin user creation
7. `migrate_email_normalization.py` - Created migration script
8. `test_forgot_password.py` - Created test suite

## Usage

The forgot password functionality now works correctly regardless of email case:

```bash
# These will all work correctly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "kpinc425@gmail.com"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "KPInc425@gmail.com"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "KPINC425@GMAIL.COM"}'
```

All three requests will successfully find the user and send a password reset email.
